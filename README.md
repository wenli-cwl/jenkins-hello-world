# Jenkins Hello World

This repository contains a simple `index.html` page and a Jenkins pipeline
for building and deploying the page to IIS on port `9091`.

The pipeline demonstrates:

* Archiving build files.
* Using environment variables and Jenkins credentials.
* Deploying to IIS after manual approval.
* Publishing a dummy package step to GitHub Packages.
* Running a sample JUnit test report.
* Sending an email notification after deployment.
